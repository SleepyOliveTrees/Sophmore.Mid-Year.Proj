        <h2>About Us!</h2>
        <p class="paragraph"><span style="color: rgb(41, 53, 28);">Garden Log was created by Yashvi Trivedi, Avneet Kaur, and Olivia Smith from Bergen County Academies' Computer Science and Technology Academy. 
          Our project contains a ToDo list and a Cash Flow calculator.
          The To-Do list functions like a calendar; it displays a weekly task list, and you can add daily tasks.
          When you finish, you can check the task off, and it turns green. Higher priority tasks can be displayed in a deeper shade of red and put at the top of the task list.
          The Cash Flow calculator displays your total cash at the top of the screen and underneath is a list that scrolls, that has all of your inputs. There is be a small bar underneath that has a “+” or  “-” option to choose whether you are adding or deducting money. User can add the amount of money and a short description about the transaction and then the number at the top will automatically change. There's also an option to clear the list
